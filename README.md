# Game of life
- This is a way to solve conway's game of life, I used [Ruby2d](https://www.ruby2d.com/) to show the functionality of the game on an external screen.

# Usability
- Run ruby game-of-life.rb in terminal.
- With the left mouse button select each cell that will be alive
- Press 'p' to start and pause the game.
- Press 'c' to clear the screen.

# Design
